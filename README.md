# customer_behavior_analysis
This project explores customer purchasing behavior using a dataset of 3,900 shopping records. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL queries,power Bi and actionable business insights.

**Customer Shopping Behavior — End-to-End Data Analytics Project**

This repository contains an end-to-end **Data Analytics Project** where we analyze customer shopping patterns, clean and process the data, run SQL queries, build visual dashboards, and create a final business insights report. The project demonstrates practical real-world analytics skills from data ingestion to reporting.

 **Project Overview**

This project aims to understand customer purchasing behavior using a dataset containing demographics, purchase details, product categories, discounts, and payment information.

The workflow covers:

* Loading and exploring the dataset in Python
* Performing data cleaning
* Running Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Executing SQL queries using MySQL Server
* Building a Power BI Dashboard
* Preparing a complete business insights report

 **Dataset Information**

**File:** `customer_shopping_behavior.csv`
**Rows:** 3,900
**Columns:** 18
**Domain:** Retail / E-commerce

The dataset includes:

* Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location)
